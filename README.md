## Rosafessor BOT

Rosafessor is like that funky Discord bot I made, all inspired by my buddy's wild gaming moves in League of Legends. Originally, we wanted a bot that gives tips exactly opposite to what the pros would say. But guess what? Rosafessor turned into this cool bot that's useful for everyone on Discord. Have a blast with Rosafessor, and stay tuned for even more awesome stuff coming your way!

## Setup

The bot is really automated its already good to go all you have to do is invite him to your server and type #help for a list of commands to see all the features the bot has.
